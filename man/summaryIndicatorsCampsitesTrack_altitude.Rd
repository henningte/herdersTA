\title{Extracts Altitudinal Differences Between Campsite Locations.}
\usage{
summaryIndicatorsCampsitesTrack_altitude(currenttrack)
}
\arguments{
\item{currenttrack}{A \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} object that
has been processed as described in the description.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} object with a row for each campsite and two
columns:
\describe{
  \item{campsite}{An identifier for each unique campsite as provided by
  \code{currenttrack$aggregatedcampsitevists.}}
  \item{altitudinaldifference}{A numeric vector representing the altitudinal
  difference between the current campsite (indicated by \code{campsite}) and the
  following campsite.}
}
}
\description{
\code{summaryIndicatorsCampsitesTrack_altitude} extracts for each
campsite the altitudinal difference to the following campsite. For the first
campsite the value is set to \code{NA} in order to indicate that the
altitudinal difference to the previous campsite is unknown. The
function can  be used in combination with a
\code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} object as returned by
\code{\link{aggregateDailyLocationsTrack}} for which unique campsite
visits are identified by a variable \code{aggregatedcmapsitevisits}.
