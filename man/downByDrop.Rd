\title{Cleans and regularises GPS tracks.}
\usage{
downByDrop(currenttrack, timeInterval = 1770)
}
\arguments{
\item{currenttrack}{A \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} object.}

\item{timeInterval}{An integer value indicating a time interval [s] as
target duration between data points of the \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}}
object. Default is \code{timeInterval = 1770} (i.e. 29.5 minutes).}
}
\value{
The downsampled \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} object.
}
\description{
\code{downByDrop} subsets the values of a \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}}
object to a regular time interval by cleaning the measured values. The first
value of the \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} object represents the starting
point of the time point specification according to the target time interval.
The last entry of a sequence of positioning measurements of the GPS tracker
(in "spy" mode) is retained assuming that the assessed position data is the
most accurate within the corresponding sequence. Points of the
\code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} object are only returned if there are at
least two data values with a time interval as long as the specified time
interval in the \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} object.
