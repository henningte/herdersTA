\title{Computes summary indicators for GPS tracks.}
\usage{
summaryIndicatorsIntervalsTrackGeneric(currenttrack, normalise = TRUE,
  fun = mean, what)
}
\arguments{
\item{currenttrack}{A \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} object that
has been processed as described in the description.}

\item{normalise}{A logical value indicating if the computed summary
indicators should be normalized relative to the duration of data values
(as specified by \code{currenttrack@data$nogapduration}) for each fixed
ten-day interval (\code{normalize = TRUE}) or not (\code{normalize = FALSE}).}

\item{fun}{A function that takes a numeric vector as input and returns
a numeric value that is used in order to temporally aggregate the values.}

\item{what}{A numeric vector with indices of the variables in
\code{currenttrack@data} to summarise.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} object with with each row representing a time
interval as specified by the slot \code{data$id_timeinterval} of \code{currenttrack}
containing the following variables:
\describe{
  \item{\code{trackid}}{A character vector with the id (name) of
  \code{currenttrack}.}
  \item{\code{ftdi}}{A character vector with the first day of the respective
  fixed ten-day interval.}
  \item{\code{distance_tot}}{A numeric value representing the (normalized)
  total distance covered during a time interval [m].}
  \item{\code{altitude_tot}}{A numeric value representing the (normalized)
  total altitudinal distance covered (i.e. each metre covered in a vertical
  distance) during a time interval [m].}
  \item{\code{altitude_distance}}{A numeric value representing the (normalized)
  total altitudinal distance covered during a time interval [m] (i.e. the
  altitudinal difference between the first point in the time interval and the
  last point).}
  \item{\code{number_campsites}}{A numeric value representing the (normalized)
  total number of unique campsites (i.e. neglecting repeated visits or counting
  locations respectively) during a time interval.}
}
}
\description{
\code{summaryIndicatorsIntervalsTrackGeneric} computes various summary indicators
for a \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} object that has been processed
with \code{\link{reorganizeTrack}}, \code{\link{locationsTrack}} and
\code{\link{aggregateDailyLocationsTrack}}. Summary
indicators are computed for a temporal resolution of fixed ten-day intervals
and additional for the transition between the first vale before
a ten-day interval and the first value of the ten-day interval. In contrast to
\code{summaryIndicatorsIntervalsTrack}, \code{summaryIndicatorsIntervalsTrackGeneric}
does not compute special summary indicators in a non-generic way, but
simply applies a user-defined function to a selection of variables of a
\code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} object.
