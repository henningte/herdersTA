\title{Computes Move Altitudinal Distances Not Ignoring Short-Term Visits}
\usage{
altitudinaldistancenextvisit_wis_campsite(agg)
}
\arguments{
\item{agg}{A \code{data.frame} object as created internally in \code{\link{aggregateTrack}}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the altitudinal linear distance between locations
of adjacent campsites along locations of short-term visits (if present). Values for a following
move
are always assigned to the last value of a campsite in \code{agg} as indicated by \code{agg$end}.
}
\description{
\code{altitudinaldistancenextvisit_wis_campsite} computes for a \code{data.frame} as created
internally in \code{\link{aggregateTrack}} the altitudinal linear distance between locations
of adjacent campsites along locations of short-term visits (if present). This is done
by summing all altitudinal distances covered between adjacent campsites as computed with
\code{\link{altitudinaldistancenextvisit_wis}}.
