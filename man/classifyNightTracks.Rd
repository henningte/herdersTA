\title{Classifies Data Values of a \code{Tracks} object as Night or Day Values.}
\usage{
classifyNightTracks(currenttracks, night)
}
\arguments{
\item{currenttracks}{A \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Tracks}} object
with \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} objects with the same time
vectors (i.e. data values for the same time interval) (as returned
by \code{\link{reorganizeTracks}}). \code{currenttracks} must have
a variable \code{time} indicating the time of all data values.}

\item{night}{An integer vector with two elements:
\enumerate{
  \item The first element specifies the start hour of the night, e.g. \code{0}
  for 0 o'clock.
  \item The first element specifies the start hour of the night, e.g. \code{4}
  for 4 o'clock.
}}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Tracks}} object identical to \code{currenttracks}
with an attribute \code{night} representing a logical vector with a value for
each data value in a \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} object in
\code{currenttracks} that is \code{TRUE} if a data value was recorded during night
and \code{FALSE} if it was recorded during day.
}
\description{
\code{classifyNightTracks} creates labels for the data values
of a \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Tracks}} object with
\code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} objects with the same time
vectors (i.e. data values for the same time interval) marking
a data value as recorded during night or during day. The decision
boundaries are specified by the user.
