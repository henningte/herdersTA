\title{Identifies clusters of points of GPS tracks.}
\usage{
extractClustersBuffer(trsSP, radius = 200)
}
\arguments{
\item{trsSP}{A \code{\link[sp]{SpatialPointsDataFrame}} object
representing a \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} object, i.e.
the result of the function
\code{\link{TrackToSpatialPointsDataFrame}}. \code{trsSP} must
have a logical variable \code{gap} as created by
\code{\link{reorganizeTracks}} and an attribute \code{night} as
created by \code{\link{classifyNightTrack}}.}

\item{radius}{A numerical value representing the radius of the
buffers computed around each point [m] which are used for
clustering values to locations. Default is \code{radius = 200} [m].}
}
\value{
An integer vector with the same length as the number of points in
\code{trsSP} indicating to which cluster each point is assigned. Cluster
indices are not ordered, however points of \code{trsSP} representing gaps
(as indicated by \code{trsSP@data$gap}) get the cluster index \code{0}.
}
\description{
\code{extractClustersBuffer} identifies clusters of points in GPS
tracks based on their spatial proximity. This is done by applying
density based clustering on all points within a specific daily time
interval (e.g. during night). Daytime data values are assigned to
the respective location id (1) if the next value after and prior the
daytime values (i.e. the last value of the previous night and the
first value of the following night) are identical (i.e. are defined
as gaps if both values are gaps or to a location id otherwise), then
(2) if the next value of the previous night is not a gap to the
respective location, and then (3) if the next value of the following
night is not a gap to the respective location. Therefore, results
reflect a daily resolution with respect to different locations.
