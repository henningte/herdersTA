\usage{
trackvisitsFromTrack(currenttrack, tmin = 345600)
}
\arguments{
\item{currenttrack}{An object of class \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}}
with a variable \code{location} that is an id for locations. Gap values
must have the value \code{0} for \code{location}. \code{currenttrack}
must contain data values for equally spaced time intervals, i.e. each value
must correspond to a time interval of the same length. Additionally,
\code{currenttrack} must contain a numeric varaibel \code{altitude}.}

\item{tmin}{The minimum residence time at a specific location [s]
which is used to classify visits as campsites (if the residence
time at a specific location is larger than \code{tmin}) in
contrast to short-term visits of locations. The default is
\code{tmin = 345600}, i.e. 4 days.}
