@article{Floyd.2019,
 abstract = {Human and livestock mobility are key factors in the transmission of several high-burden zoonoses such as rift valley fever and trypanosomiasis, yet our knowledge of this mobility is relatively poor due to difficulty in quantifying population-level movement patterns. Significant variation in the movement patterns of individual hosts means it is necessary to capture their fine-scale mobility in order to gain useful knowledge that can be extrapolated to a population level. Here we explore how the movements of people and their ruminants, and their exposure to various types of land cover, correlate with ruminant ownership and other demographic factors which could affect individual exposure to zoonoses. The study was conducted in Busia County, western Kenya, where the population are mostly subsistence farmers operating a mixed crop/livestock farming system. We used GPS trackers to collect movement data from 26 people and their ruminants for 1 week per individual in July/August 2016, and the study was repeated at the end of the same year to compare movement patterns between the short rainy and dry seasons respectively. We found that during the dry season, people and their ruminants travelled further on trips outside of the household, and that people spent less time on swampland compared to the short rainy season. Our findings also showed that ruminant owners spent longer and travelled further on trips outside the household than non-ruminant owners, and that people and ruminants from poorer households travelled further than people from relatively wealthier households. These results indicate that some individual-level mobility may be predicted by season and by household characteristics such as ruminant ownership and household wealth, which could have practical uses for assessing individual risk of exposure to some zoonoses and for future modelling studies of zoonosis transmission in similar rural areas.},

@incollection{Seneviratne.2012,
 abstract = {This chapter addresses changes in weather and climate events relevant to extreme impacts and disasters. An extreme (weather or climate) event is generally defined as the occurrence of a value of a weather or climate variable above (or below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends (‘tails’) of the range of observed values of the variable. Some climate extremes (e.g., droughts, floods) may be the result of an accumulation of weather or climate events that are, individually, not extreme themselves (though their accumulation is extreme). As well, weather or climate events, even if not extreme in a statistical sense, can still lead to extreme conditions or impacts, either by crossing a critical threshold in a social, ecological, or physical system, or by occurring simultaneously with other events. A weather system such as a tropical cyclone can have an extreme impact, depending on where and when it approaches landfall, even if the specific cyclone is not extreme relative to other tropical cyclones. Conversely, not all extremes necessarily lead to serious impacts. [3.1] Many weather and climate extremes are the result of natural climate variability (including phenomena such as El Niño), and natural decadal or multi-decadal variations in the climate provide the backdrop for anthropogenic climate changes. Even if there were no anthropogenic changes in climate, a wide variety of natural weather and climate extremes would still occur. [3.1] A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of weather and climate extremes, and can result in unprecedented extremes. Changes in extremes can also be directly related to changes in mean climate, because mean future conditions in some variables are projected to lie within the tails of present-day conditions. Nevertheless, changes in extremes of a climate or weather variable are not always related in a simple way to changes in the mean of the same variable, and in some cases can be of opposite sign to a change in the mean of the variable. Changes in phenomena such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation or monsoons could affect the frequency and intensity of extremes in several regions simultaneously.},

 abstract = {Introduction -- Getting Started with ggplot2 -- Toolbox -- Mastering the Grammar -- Building a Plot Layer by Layer -- Scales, Axes and Legends -- Positioning -- Themes -- Data Analysis -- Data Transformation -- Modelling for Visualisation -- Programming with ggplot2 -- Index -- R Code Index

This new edition to the classic book by ggplot2 creator Hadley Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and RStudio. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that helps users create data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: • produce handsome, publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from the plot specification • superimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with automatically adjusted common scales • add customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalized additive models, and robust regression • save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse • create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to multiple plots • approach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. New to this edition:< • Brings the book up-to-date with ggplot2 1.0, including major updates to the theme system • New scales, stats and geoms added throughout • Additional practice exercises • A revised introduction that focuses on ggplot() instead of qplot() • Updated chapters on data and modeling using tidyr, dplyr and broom},
