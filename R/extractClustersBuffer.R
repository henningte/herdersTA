#' Identifies clusters of points of GPS tracks.
#'
#' \code{extractClustersBuffer} identifies clusters of points in GPS
#' tracks based on their spatial proximity. This is done by applying
#' density based clustering on all points within a specific daily time
#' interval (e.g. during night). Daytime data values are assigned to
#' the respective location id (1) if the next value after and prior the
#' daytime values (i.e. the last value of the previous night and the
#' first value of the following night) are identical (i.e. are defined
#' as gaps if both values are gaps or to a location id otherwise), then
#' (2) if the next value of the previous night is not a gap to the
#' respective location, and then (3) if the next value of the following
#' night is not a gap to the respective location. Therefore, results
#' reflect a daily resolution with respect to different locations.
#'
#' @param currenttrack An object of class \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}}.
#' \code{currenttrack} must have a logical variable \code{gap} as created by
#' \code{\link{reorganizeTracks}} and an attribute \code{night} as
#' created by \code{\link{classifyNightTrack}}.
#' @param radius A numerical value representing the radius of the
#' buffers computed around each point [m] which are used for
#' clustering values to locations. Default is \code{radius = 200} [m].
#' @return An integer vector with the same length as the number of points in
#' \code{currenttrack} indicating to which cluster each point is assigned. Cluster
#' indices are not ordered, however points of \code{trsSP} representing gaps
#' (as indicated by \code{currenttrack$gap}) get the cluster index \code{0}.
