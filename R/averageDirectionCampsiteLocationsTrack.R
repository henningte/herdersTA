#' Computes the average direction (as absolute difference of angles) between campsite locations of a Track object in the order of movement.
#'
#' \code{averageDirectionCampsiteLocationsTrack} computes the average direction between
#' locations of a \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}} in the order of movement.
#' Directions are computed as angle difference between the previous campsite location
#' and the current campsite location and the next campsite location and the current
#' campsite location. Several options are available.
#'
#' @param currenttrack An object of class \code{\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Track}}
#' with a variable \code{location} and \code{campsite}
#' @param fun One of \code{mean} or \code{median)}, depending on which function should be
#' used in order to compute average values.
#' @return a numeric value representing the average direction between
#' locations in \code{currenttrack} in the order of movement.
