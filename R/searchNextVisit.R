#' Determines the number of visits of a cluster.
#'
#' \code{searchNextVisit} checks whether the clusters/campsites have been
#' visited more than the currently known visits (\code{times_visited}).
#' Updates \code{times_visited} and determines the end (latest point in cell)
#' of the current visit. This function is used by function `
#' \code{\link{clusterOrder}}.
#'
#' @param clusters A \code{\link[sp]{SpatialGridDataFrame}} object containing
#' point clusters, as created with \code{\link{extractClusters}}.
#' @param trs_spdf A \code{\link[sp]{SpatialPointsDataFrame}} of the
#' household movement (as converted from a \code {\link[trajectories:Track-class]{Tracks}}
#' object).
#' @return A \code{\link[sp]{SpatialPointsDataFrame}} holding the
#' clusters/campsites with updated \code{times_visited}.
